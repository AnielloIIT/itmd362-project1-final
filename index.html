          Congratulations friend you have finally broke free from your slavery 
          and you are now on your way to ascending to greatness. All your life 
          you have been told how to game, when to game, even who you can game with, 
          no more. That time ends now because after reading this webpage you 
          will be ready to swallow the red pill and break out of the matrix.

          <h3>Why PC Master Race?</h3>
          <p>
            Gaming on PC is the ultimate freedom. You have the choice to use 
            multiple monitors, game at unlocked frame rates, use multiple voice 
            chat applications (for free), play online for free, never pay full 
            price for a game, play games with better graphics than consoles, 
            attach mods to your favorite games, you will never have to pay to 
            play online (unless you play World of Warcraft), have the freedom to 
            choose how you play your games (keyboard or controller).

          <h3>You Have Been Fooled!!! But Hope Has Arrived.</h3>
          <p>
            If you have ever bought a console for gaming then I am here to tell 
            you that you have been ripped off! Most of the AAA game titles are on PC,
             in fact PC has a larger selection of games than the consoles do. Sick of 
             paying to paly online then get a PC. You do not have a pay wall blocking 
             you from playing with your friends online. PC uses the same p2p networking as 
             consoles do, why should you have to pay extra? I know you have been there and 
             got a new console in hopes that all your games from the last generation will 
             work on the new system. As of lately the consoles are not backwards compatible, 
             and game companies make you rebuy games you already own. On the PC your games 
             stay with your forever, gone are the days of having to rebuy everything over 
             and over again.

          <h3>Well Gaming On Pc Is Expensive Right?</h3>
          <p>
            To be honest it can and cannot be expensive. You can go crazy and dump 2000 into your
            PC, but you do not need to go all out just to game on PC. In fact, for the same price
            as a console you can build a pc that will have much better graphics. It is a logical 
            choice, I mean why buy a computer and then buy another separate console to game on 
            when you can just buy a PC to work and play on both.  Plus, you donâ€™t have to pay 
            for online. I mean you are already paying for the internet, right? Think about all 
            the money you will save because you never have to pay full price for a game again. 
            There is only winning when you join the glorious PC Master Race.
